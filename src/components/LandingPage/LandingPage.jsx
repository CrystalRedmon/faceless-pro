    Our mission is to eliminate discrimination during the application process.
At Faceless Pro, we believe that the best candidate should be determined by
skills and experience and not on physical attributes. 
Our vision is to provide a one-stop platform that solves all the problems encountered during the recruitment process for both the employers and the employee.

Functional Issues
1. Cannot edit profile as a candidate.
2. SQL is not completed/correct for fetching the candidates info on the /CandidatePage and clicking 'My Profile' in nav bar.
3. No way to check if a candidate has completed their profile to apply to a job. Candidate only needs to complete information in the candidate table in the database. It will not render correctly for the employer if they have not completed the required steps 1 - 6.
4. Refreshing the page or going back to view job details for the candidate breaks the app.
5. Candidates can apply to the same job post as many times as they want.
6. Saving a job does not remove it from the search for job page.
7. As a candidate user, getting the 'complete your profile to save and apply to job postings' button prompt is not correct even if they have done so. Page needs to be refreshed.
8. Candidates can go through the profile setup as many times as they want. There is nothing preventing them from INSERTING multiple rows with their user id in the candidate table.
9. Candidates must completed step 1, which inserts into the candidate table, in order to add their resume and cover letter.
